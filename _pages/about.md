I'm an ambitious and driven person with interests in areas like Data Science, Machine Learning, Search/Planning Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence in general. Recently, I've been attributed an investigation scholarship from FCT, to work on my master thesis dissertation project, which is born from a joint effort between IDMEC-IST and IPO Porto. This project has the objective of creating an intelligent system capable of predicting aspects about the postoperative state of cancer patients. Being my first real world Data Science project, I'm currently becoming more proficient with the use of libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Seaborn and others. And I've also worked with popular frameworks such as Tensorflow to build a convolutional neural network for image classification/recognition, in the past.</p>

Software Engineering has also been a constant on my academic path, more specifically areas like Software Architecture, Formal Software Specification, Verification and Testing. More recently, I dived into the field of advanced programming with the introduction of Introspection and Intercession. Along all this time I've come to use many different programming languages, and today I consider myself a very quick learner. After having a strong grasp of the paradigm behind coding in general it becomes easier to learn new languages and tools. Among the languages I'm most familiar with, I'd list the following ones:</p>

* Python
* Java
* Lisp
* Julia

<p style="text-align: justify">
To complement this list of languages there are other technologies I've made use of during the past years. Databases were also a focus of my studies and interests starting with SQL, going though the wonders of NoSQL databases and more recently with the introduction to data warehouses. Within this set of tools, I'd highlight the following:</p>

* SQL Server
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Apache Cassandra
* Neo4j
* MongoDB
* Redis
* SQLite
* Pentaho's Data Toolset

Cyber-Security was once part of my main interests, while I was finishing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at University of Aveiro. In this context I've developed a project along with 2 other colleagues which consisted of creating a Java/Android Library to allow the secure exchange of geolocation information among friends, entitled "Catch Me If You Can". This library made use of encryption algorithms and the GeoHash framework developed at MIT, and took care of the encryption key storage and secure contact management. Not only the library was developed but also was integrated in an already existing app called OwnTracks, working as a proof of concept.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
To conclude my experience and toolset description, I've also worked with numerous programming IDEs like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Netbeans, Eclipse, among others. All this across various operative systems like Windows, Ubuntu and even Arch Linux, one of the most hardcore bare bone flavors of Linux. Like any student, I've vastly worked with the Microsoft Office toolset but and in the last years I've been preferring to work with LaTex. Finally, Git is one of the most precious tools, in my opinion, since it contributes so much to an effective and efficient team work and safe version control.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
That being said, along the academic path of any computer science student the projects will be mostly developed in groups and the success of each project is often dependent on the intra group coordination. More than the words I can write, there are proven results in my record, and so far being a hard working and determined person who likes to lead by example, happily acceptant of new challenges, has paid of.</p>
