I'm an ambitious and driven person with interests in areas like Data Science, Machine Learning, Search and Planning Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence in general. Recently I've been attributed an investigation scholarship from FCT to work on my master thesis dissertation project, which is born from a joint effort between IDMEC-IST and IPO Porto. This project has the objective of creating an intelligent system capable of predicting aspects about the postoperative state of cancer patients. Being my first real world Data Science project, I'm currently making use of libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Seaborn and others. And I've also worked with popular frameworks such as Tensorflow to build a convolutional neural network for image classification/recognition.

Software Engineering has also been a constant on my academic path, more specifically areas like Software Architecture, Formal Software Specification, Verification and Testing. More recently, I dived into the field of advanced programming with the introduction of Introspection and Intercession.

Along all this time I've come to use many different programming languages, and today I consider myself a very quick learner, after having the grasp of the paradigm behind coding in general. Among the languages I'm most familiar with, I'd list the following ones:

* Python
* Java
* Lisp
* Julia

To complement this list of languages there are other technologies I've made use of during the past years. Databases were also a focus of my studies and interests starting with SQL, going though the wonders of NoSql databases and more recently with the introduction to data wharehouses. Within this set of tools, I'd highlight the following:

* SQL Server
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Apache Cassandra
* Neo4j
* MongoDB
* Redis
* SQLite
* Pentaho's Data Toolset
